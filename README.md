- 👋 Hi, I’m @InfinateEmpty
- 👀 I’m interested in building out the world with growing ideas and learning as much as I can along the way. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Git basics and am working toward understanding the basics of certain code languages I'm interested in. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas based in financial reasoning, machine learning/ automation, and/or time management/practactality based problems. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I will be setting up a seperate mail for this account and checking it regularly, but for now, please just send any comments or ideas to my git inbox. Thanks Everyone, and take care.
